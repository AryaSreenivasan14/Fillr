Project Space Game

Created Player and Enemies
Can fire bullet to enemies
Life will be lost when struck by an enemy bullet

Flaws:
Collision detection is not precise (if we use game engine and physics, it would be more precise)
Using spritekit or other game engines, animation with spritesheets can be included to make the game look nice
Can adapt to a specific design pattern when we use other libraries for developing games.
